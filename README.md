## Description

This is the backend component of a basic social media API. The program included provides the paths that associates friends, thoughts, and reactions to thoughts with user accounts, stored to thier `User` object all on the server side. Users' information is stored and organized using Mongoose DB, and the paths were tested using Insomnia through a local host.

### User Story
```
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

### Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a social network API

WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose 
models are synced to the MongoDB database

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, 
and delete users and thoughts in my database

WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to 
thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```
